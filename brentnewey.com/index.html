	<h4>Principal Software Engineer</h4>

	<p>At TripAdvisor, my responsibility shifted to technical leadership. I was the team lead and primary architect for the creation of and migration to a central supply platform for all of TripAdvisor Vacation Rentals (TAVR). I have worked on solutions for Flights, Commerce, Hotels, Internal Supply, and just about everywhere else in the company, designing solutions in Java, Python, Postgres, and more recently migrating these systems to AWS using Lambda, ECS, Aurora, DynamoDb, DocumentDb, CDK, and many other cloud technologies.</p>

	<p>During this time I have led teams of up to twelve engineers in implementing the migration of the Rent by Owner and Property Management platforms to the TAVR central supply platform. I also interviewed prospective Java developers and mentored senior engineers, teaching interview, project management, and design and code review techniques.</p>
