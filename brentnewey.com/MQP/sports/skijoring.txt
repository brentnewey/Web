SKIJORING (http://www.northernterritories.com/Skijoring.htm)

Skijoring is the sport of being pulled on skis by a dog or dogs in harness. It's the simplest, most intimate form of dog driving there is. Skijoring can be done by anyone with adequate skiing skills, and with virtually any breed of dog that weighs more than about 30 pounds--as long as the dog is willing! Only a few items of equipment are necessary to start out in this sport. You'll need skis, boots and poles, of course. Most skijorers use cross country touring skis or skating skis, though skating skis are best on wide, flat, well-groomed trails. The dog's harness can be either an X-back or H-back racing harness, but NOT a weight-pulling harness. The skijorer wears a skijoring belt, at least 3 to 4 inches wide across the back, to which is attached a skijoring line that hooks into the back of the dog's harness. There are refinements to each of these items, but the basic setup is very simple.
