Pachyderm Polo (http://www.corkscrew-balloon.com/polo/94/)

Pachyderm polo is a version of equine polo, except that instead of the players riding a horse, they ride
an elephant. With a few exceptions, the rules of equine polo work for pachyderm polo. The impracticality
 of eight five-ton mounts crowding around a three-inch ball was evident. To circumvent congestion, one 
player from each team remains on his side of the midfield at all times. In addition, an arc is marked around 
the goal itself on each side, and only two players from each team may be within the boundaries of this 
semicircle. Hooking is not permitted. Nor is riding off (the very real possibility of having one’s leg crushed between two mammoth mounts being somewhat disconcerting). The elephant polo field, at 120 yards by 70 yards, is somewhat smaller than equine polo fields to allow for the elephants’ dignified pace. A game consists of two 10-minute chukkers with a 15-minute break at halftime. Mallets are 98 to 110 inches in length, depending on the height of the elephant, and are quite heavy. Players usually bandage their wrists to provide the additional strength required for those difficult under-the-trunk shots.
