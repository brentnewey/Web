<p>Long the chip of choice for enthusiasts on a budget, AMD's Athlon XP
now finds itself in a battle to maintain its status over Intel's
faster-running Pentium 4, according to vendors of high-performance desktop
PCs.

<p>Intel's relentless speed updates to the P4 (it's up to 2.8 GHz now),
plus its faster 533-MHz bus and new, faster 1066 RDRAM have helped Intel PCs
catch up with AMD-based computers in Falcon's benchmarks, Berdelmann says.

<p>Despite a slight price premium on Intel PCs, gamers and others who
demand the best performance are often willing to spend that little bit extra, he
says.

<p>An industry analyst states that AMD's delay of Clawhammer hurt.
In-Stat/MDR General Manager Kevin Krewell says AMD's decision affects
buyers' perceptions more than it is likely to hurt actual sales.

<p>"This weakens their case that they're a stable and reliable supplier,"
he says. "They need to keep up with Intel in terms of market perception and
leadership issues."<br>

<p>While the competition for domination in the processor market continues,
people have begun to look to alternatives to desktop machines.
Year after year, notebooks win over converts from the desktop. Prices
for some portables are below $1,000, and the majority sell for $2,000 or less.
Power users can find displays as big as 16 inches and resolutions as high
as 1,600 by 1,200 pixels. Road warriors and executives now have decent
choices, and some weigh less than 3 pounds. The result of all these
advances in the market: A fifth of all computers sold worldwide this year
will be notebooks, according to research firm Gartner, about 30 million in
all. That's an increase of about 2 percentage points a year since
2000.

<p>Classifying laptops by size and weight is useful, but it doesn't tell the whole story. Size no longer correlates to the number of features a laptop can have.<br>

<p>The most recent beta build of AIM 5.1 takes a very quiet, very small
step towards interoperability with ICQ, acquired by AOL in 1998. AIM 5.1 now allows users to add ICQ buddies to the AIM contact list, then see that they're online, and send them messages. ICQ users, however, are still in the cold; although they're supposed to receive messages and be able to reply, they can't put AIM pals on their buddy list nor initiate a conversation.

<p>Other than the slow, small steps AOL is taking, AIM 5.1 doesn't appear
to offer more features or fewer ads than the in-release AIM 5.0. Considering
that and the prowess of the $25 Trillian Pro or even the for-free Trillian
.74, there's no reason to stoop as low as AIM. If you want working
communication between AIM and ICQ, Trillian remains the real deal--at
least for now. Check back for our full review of the final release of AIM
5.1.<br>

<p>In other web-related news, XDocs, Microsoft's proposed document format, will make it easier to create richly formatted online forms, and to simplify the collection of form data. Because it uses XML, XDocs form data should integrate with a variety of data repositories with relative ease.

<p>Many view Xdocs as an obvious challenger to Adobe Acrobat in the online forms market. In that narrow field, it's clear why XDocs is perceived as a threat:
Forms, by their nature, require a client and a server. Between their
virtual lock on the office productivity suite market and the popularity of
SQL Server, Exchange, and the rest of the .Net server products, Microsoft
can address both sides of the forms equation.

<p>While Acrobat Reader may be everywhere, it's safe to say that it
probably isn't used as often as Office. And that may be what hurts Adobe in the long run.<br><a href="4.html">Click here to learn more...</a>

<p>Because of the increasing need for high-speed internet, there are
advances constantly being made. A start-up company plans to announce new
antenna technology on Monday that it says can expand the limits of a popular
wireless Internet format, providing access to hundreds or even thousands
of portable computer users at distances of more than 2,000 feet within
buildings and about four miles outdoors.

<p>The antenna uses the 802.11 technical standard, also known as Wi-Fi, which
is currently limited to providing wireless Internet access to several
dozen users within a few hundred feet of the transmitter. Wi-Fi is
increasingly common in offices, airports, places like Starbucks shops and
even in a growing number of households.

<p>Executives for the start-up company, Vivato, based here, said they
expected their technology to be especially suited to office buildings
because it would enable so many more people to use a single Wi-Fi Internet
connection simultaneously.<br>
