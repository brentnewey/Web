<p>Long the chip of choice for enthusiasts on a budget, AMD's Athlon XP
now finds itself in a battle to maintain its status over Intel's
faster-running Pentium 4, according to vendors of high-performance desktop
PCs.

<p>Last year at this time nearly 98 percent of all Falcon Northwest
PCs shipped with an Athlon CPU, says Bradd Berdelmann, Falcon's general
manager. The company specializes in high-performance computers.

<p>But this year, the P4 has battled its way back into the hearts of many
enthusiasts, he says. Falcon expects its customers to order about 50
percent AMD and 50 percent Intel systems this holiday season.<br>

<p>While the competition for domination in the processor market continues,
people have begun to look to notebooks as alternatives to desktop machines.
Power users can find displays as big as 16 inches and resolutions as high
as 1,600 by 1,200 pixels. Road warriors and executives now have decent
choices, and some weigh less than 3 pounds. The result of all these
advances in the market: A fifth of all computers sold worldwide this year
will be notebooks, according to research firm Gartner, about 30 million in
all. That's an increase of about 2 percentage points a year since 2000.<br>

<p>An increased demand for processing power results in an increased demand
for standards that allow interoperability of software. The most recent beta build of AIM 5.1 takes a very quiet, very small
step towards interoperability with ICQ, the mega-IM client that AOL acquired in
1998. Without any fanfare, AIM 5.1, says AOL, now allows users to add ICQ
buddies to the AIM contact list, then see that they're online, and send
them messages. ICQ users, however, are still in the cold; although they're
supposed to receive messages and be able to reply, they can't put AIM pals
on their buddy list nor initiate a conversation.<br>

<p>In other web-related news, XDocs, according to Microsoft, will make it
easier to create richly formatted online forms, and to simplify the collection
of form data. Because it uses XML, XDocs form data should integrate with a
variety of data repositories with relative ease.

<p>In the field of online form markets, it's clear why XDocs is perceived
as a threat: Forms, by their nature, require a client and a server. Between their
virtual lock on the office productivity suite market and the popularity of
SQL Server, Exchange, and the rest of the .Net server products, Microsoft
can address both sides of the forms equation.<br>

<p>Because of the increasing need for high-speed internet, there are
advances constantly being made. A start-up company plans to announce new
antenna technology on Monday that it says can expand the limits of a popular
wireless Internet format, providing access to hundreds or even thousands
of portable computer users at distances of more than 2,000 feet within
buildings and about four miles outdoors.

<p>The antenna uses the 802.11 technical standard, also known as Wi-Fi, which
is currently limited to providing wireless Internet access to several
dozen users within a few hundred feet of the transmitter.<br>
