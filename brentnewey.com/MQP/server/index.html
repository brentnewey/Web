    This project is being undertaken as a <a href="http://www.cs.wpi.edu/Programs/mqps/">Major Qualifying Project</a> in the <a href="http://www.cs.wpi.edu">Computer Science Department</a> at WPI.<br><br>
    Duration: A'02 - C'03. <b>Now D'03</b><br><br>

  <h3>Problem Statement:</h3> To find the optimal layout for a given hypermedia.  That is, to find a solution that maximizes user efficiency.  This will
    be accomplished using a self-modifying system based on a user model collected from usage statistics.  These statistics will be processed using
    an algorithm that simulates evolutionary growth to obtain a solution starting from a random set.

  <h3>Team members:</h3> Brent Newey, Anitra Setchell, Michael Wicks.
