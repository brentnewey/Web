Underwater Hockey is a fun, fast-moving game that played on the bottom of a swimming pool. It is a great team-building sport, since success (scoring) depends on all team members working together (noone can hold their breath forever - you have to come up for air sometime). It's a great aerobic workout, and it's kind to sinuses, knees, hips and other body joints. It is one of the few games in which men and women can compete equally. It's played by two teams of 6 players with 4 substitutes per side. In competition, a game is 30 minutes long, with a 3 minute break at half-time. There are no offsides - players can move freely throughout the pool. All you need to play is a mask, fins, snorkel, stick and puck. Ear protection (typically water polo caps) is required for tournament play, and most players also wear a protective glove on their stick hand. It also helps to have something to use as goals. A variety of things can be used, even weighted cones. Ideally the pool should be 25 m x 15 m and 2-3 m deep all the way across, but anything will do, even slopes (just change ends at half-time). Goals are 3 meters long (competition goals are stainless or galvanized steel and have a little trough in them). Lead weights and 3 meters of rope can be used as the goals, though the sound of the puck thunking into the back of a metal goal is very satisfying and should be experienced!
