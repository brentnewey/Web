ETON FIVES (http://uk.sports.yahoo.com/030205/80/drmka.html)

Eton fives is a doubles game in which players smack a cork ball against the three-sided 
outdoor court with their hands rather than with rackets. The name fives is thought to 
derive from an old slang word for hands. Fives demands a lot of hand-eye co-ordination 
as the ball ricochets around the court. The best shots are not the fastest but those that 
bounce off the buttress at an unpredictable angle. It is about the only sport where the 
server does not have an advantage, because if the player taking the rebound does not like 
the serve he can ask for the ball to be served again. Since there are no umpires, disputes, 
such as when players get in each other's way, are resolved by replaying the point. Eton 
fives was first codified in 1877, around the same time rules were written for rugby union 
and soccer. But unlike these better-known sports, Eton fives never made the leap from its 
private school origins.
