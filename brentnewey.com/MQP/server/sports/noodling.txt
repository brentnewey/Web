NOODLING (http://www.dto.com/fwfishing/methods/method.jsp?Articleid=152&Articletypeid=107)

Noodling is the sport of catching cat-fish with one's bare hands. The origins of the name noodling are unknown, but it is speculated that it comes from the slippery nature of the catfish, which can feel like a wet noodle. Noodling is legal in only a handful of states, most of them being in the southern United States, where catfish can weigh over 100 pounds. The story of noodling on the American frontier became intertwined with the legends associated with catfish, such as their supposed gargantuan size and propensity to eat small children. For example, in Mark Twain’s Life on the Mississippi, a catfish six foot long and weighing 250 pounds is claimed to have been seen. Another factor contributing to the development of noodling was that it has the very practical aspect of being able to put a lot of meat on the table in a short amount of time, as most specimens taken this way are quite large. Shelter for a nesting catfish, such as along submerged highways, under rocks or mud banks, hollow logs, or inside of abandoned drums. Once favorite nesting sites have been found for a body of water, catfish are likely to be in the same spots year after year.
