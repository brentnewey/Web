<h3>Summary written by Anitra</h3>

<h4>Adaptive Websites:</h4>
<ul>
<li>deals with the idea of an "assistant" to make suggestions or small changes to a particular site, including:</li>
	<ul>
	<li>"promotion" - make a link easier to find by putting it (or a copy of it) closer to the front page of the site or closer to the top of the page</li>
	<li>"hilighting" - changing the color/graphic/font of a link to emphasize it. A "lightweight alteration".</li>
	<li>"linking" - placing a link to connect two pages that were previously unconnected - deals with conceptual & semantic relations existing in users' minds.</li>
	<li>"clustering" - taking a group of related pages and creates a new page to link to all of them. Recognises similarities in documents based on filename, location/path, and user access. May even be possible to find relations based on content (index whole files).</li>
	</ul>
<li>also addresses the question "Why are adaptive websites needed?"</li>
	<ul>
	<li>can customize for different types/groups of users, not just individual users or all users as a whole.</li>
	<li>helps to recognise when user perceptions of the site differ from how the site was designed.</li>
	<li>user needs change with time - so can the website.</li>
	</ul>
</ul>

<p>Important quote: "Although a service like WebThreads can be extremely useful, path data can also be heuristically inferred from standard server logs. If we assume that accesses originating from the same machine at around the same time correspond to the visit of a single user making a coherent series of page visits, we can record sequences of pages accessed by individual visitors. We can construct a graph of the site, where nodes represent pages and directed arcs represent links, and match these sequences against the graph to determine the full path followed. "</p>
