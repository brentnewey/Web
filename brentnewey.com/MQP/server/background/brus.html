<h3>Summary by Brent Newey</h3>

<p>Brusilovsky discusses the requirements, techniques, and applications of Adaptive 
Hypermedia from the perspective of existing hypermedia applications.  The following is
a basic outline of the paper:
<ul>
<li>Methods and Techniques of Adaptive Hypermedia</li>
  <ul>
  <li>A review of where they are used and what specifically is adapted.</li>
  <li>What the goals of existing systems are and what they should be.</li>
  <li>What features of the user should be used to perform the adaptation.</li>
  <li>The two types of adaptive hypermedia: Adaptive Presentation and Adaptive Navigation
      Support.</li>
  <li>The main ways in which a website can have its presentation adapted: hiding, annotation,
      and reordering.
  </ul>
<li>In what situations is Hypermedia most useful</li>
  <ul>
  <li>A discussion on a variety of applications in terms of knowledge level of the user and how

  <li>Page manipulation: fragment variants vs. page variants.</li>
  <li>Achieving adaptation goals, such as guidance and orientation for the user.</li>
  </ul>
<li>User Modeling</li>
  <ul>
  <li>Specificity of the topic in regards to Adaptive Hypermedia.</li>
