<center><b>Pacific Giant Salamander</b></center>
<br><blockquote>

Salamanders are species of amphibians that have tails (they are part of the order Caudata, family Salamandridae).
There are two species of the Pacific Giant Salamander. They both have very powerful jaws and have a very painful bite. While living mostly on the ground, a few have been found up in trees. One of the few salamanders that is vocal, they will sort of "bark" when they are frightened.
They mate in the spring and the female lays about 100 eggs near a river or stream.
Loss of habitat has caused them to be close to an endangered species in British Columbia.
Mostly nocturnal, they hide under damp mosses and logs during the day. They do burrow and can dig (they have hard nails).
These salamanders love to be near cooler lakes and streams.
The Pacific Giant Salamander will discharge a terrible tasting milky substance from the top of their tails to help fight off predators.
