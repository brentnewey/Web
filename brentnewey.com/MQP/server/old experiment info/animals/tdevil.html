<br><blockquote>

The Tasmanian devil is a marsupial.
They are mostly black, but do have some white markings (usually on the chest and rump). Males are larger than females and can weigh up to 12 kg, and stand about 30 cm high at the shoulder. Their life span is about 7 -8 years. They have an excellent sense of smell.
Tasmanian devils live in underground burrows. They are nocturnal and mostly solitary (except when mating or feeding together). Females give birth to up to four pups. 
With their jet black appearance, frightening screams, and powerful teeth and jaws, the Tasmanian devil sometimes strikes fear into people. In reality, younger devils are easily handled by children.  Tasmanian devils are scavengers and will eat everything from a dead carcass except the very largest bones. Many times they will feed on a dead animal together. As scavengers, they are good for the land because they remove dead carcasses.
However, they are also predators, and have a very strong jaw with a powerful set of teeth. While mostly found on the ground, they can climb trees. Tasmania, the home of the Tasmanian devil, has the highest average rainfall of any Australian State.
