<center><b>Mantella</b></center>

<br><blockquote>

Mantellas are only found on the island of Madagascar. There are about 13 different species of Mantellas.
While some are poisonous and even look like poison arrow frogs, they are not the same.
Most Mantellas are one to two inches in length.
Males have been known to fight with each other over territory.
Mantella males "call" during the day, probably trying to attract females.
Mantellas can be found in a variety of colors and patterns.
Unlike many amphibians, they do not have webbing on their hands and feet.
The female lays small, jelly covered patches of 12-24 eggs on the ground. Some species may lay more eggs.
Mantellas are generally found on the ground, however, some species will climb and breed in trees.
