<p>Long the chip of choice for enthusiasts on a budget, AMD's Athlon XP now finds itself in a battle to maintain its status over Intel's faster-running Pentium 4, according to vendors of high-performance desktop PCs.

<p>Last year at this time nearly 98 percent of all Falcon Northwest PCs shipped with an Athlon CPU, says Bradd Berdelmann, Falcon's general manager. The company specializes in high-performance computers.

<p>But this year, the P4 has battled its way back into the hearts of many enthusiasts, he says. Falcon expects its customers to order about 50 percent AMD and 50 percent Intel systems this holiday season.

<p>Intel's relentless speed updates to the P4 (it's up to 2.8 GHz now), plus its faster 533-MHz bus and new, faster 1066 RDRAM have helped Intel PCs catch up with AMD-based computers in Falcon's benchmarks, Berdelmann says. (Recent PCWorld.com tests have shown similar results.)

<p>In September, AMD announced delays in the release of an updated Athlon chip with a larger L2 cache, code-named Barton, and its next-generation desktop processor, code-named Clawhammer. The Hammer chip will support both 32-bit and 64-bit programs and is expected to offer significantly higher megahertz than current Athlons.

<p>That delay, plus Intel's pending release of a 3-GHz P4, has hurt AMD's image. "AMD is hurting compared to six months ago in terms of
mind share," says Berdelmann. "They were looking for a performance win in the fourth quarter with Clawhammer, and that would have been a home run for them."

<p>An industry analyst agrees that AMD's delay of Clawhammer hurt.
In-Stat/MDR General Manager Kevin Krewell says AMD's decision affects
buyers' perceptions more than it is likely to hurt actual sales.

<p>"This weakens their case that they're a stable and reliable supplier," he says. "They need to keep up with Intel in terms of market perception and leadership issues."<br>

<p>While the competition for domination in the processor market continues, people have begun to look to alternatives to desktop machines. Year after year, notebooks win over converts from the desktop. Prices for some portables are below $1,000, and the majority sell for $2,000 or less. Power users can find displays as big as 16 inches, with resolutions as high as 1,600 by 1,200 pixels. Road warriors and executives now have decent choices, and some weigh less than 3 pounds. The result of all these advances in the market: A fifth of all computers sold worldwide this year will be notebooks, according to research firm Gartner, about 30 million in all. That's an increase of about 2 percentage points a year since 2000.

<p>As technology advances, classifying notebooks solely by size and weight proves problematic, because size no longer correlates to the number of features. We prefer to outline your choices as combinations of user type and system size. Some notebook makers classify users by the size of their businesses, but this is often done merely to steer them to the right phone bank of sales reps, since the machines are similar except for slightly different software installations (called preloads or hot loads).

<p>If your decision is solely based on size and weight, there are multiple categories to choose from, including the full-size notebook (or desktop replacement notebook, or just notebook), weighing 6 to 8 pounds, with two or three drives (it's no longer a given that the floppy disk drive is internal); the mainstream thin-and-light notebook, or subnotebook, weighing 4 to 6 pounds, with two internal drives, one of which is typically removable; and the ultraportable, weighing 2.5 to 4 pounds, with just an integrated hard drive.

<p>If you are selecting a laptop, you should also give serious consideration to how you are going to use it. A laptop primarily used for presentations should have different specifications than one used as a more portable desktop computer.<br>

<p>The most recent beta build of AIM 5.1 takes a very quiet, very small step towards interoperability with ICQ, the mega-IM client that AOL acquired in 1998. Without any fanfare, AIM 5.1, says AOL, now allows users to add ICQ buddies to the AIM contact list, then see that they're online, and send them messages. ICQ users, however, are still in the cold; although they're supposed to receive messages and be able to reply, they can't put AIM pals on their buddy list nor initiate a conversation.

<p>We didn't have quite the experience that the beta promised. Although
AIM 5.1 let us add ICQ users to our buddy list--AIM and its servers were smart
enough to recognize the ICQ numerical addresses and ask us to assign them
more memorable, human names--when we tested the AIM-to-ICQ connection, we
struck out. ICQ users didn't show as being online even when they were, and
we were unable to send messages to them--ever.

<p>That may change, of course, since the work that AOL is doing to bring
together its two clients is primarily on the server end. For now, however,
the best thing about AIM 5.1 is that it integrates with Microsoft's
Outlook Express e-mail client (but not the more powerful Outlook) under
Windows XP to show your buddy list in the Contact panel. Interestingly,
AIM simply replaces the contacts normally inserted there by Windows
Messenger, so you can't see buddies from both AIM and Windows Messenger.
That's a low blow!

<p>Other than the slow, small steps AOL is taking, AIM 5.1 doesn't appear
to offer more features or fewer ads than the in-release AIM 5.0. Considering
that and the prowess of the $25 Trillian Pro or even the for-free Trillian
.74, there's no reason to stoop as low as AIM. If you want working
communication between AIM and ICQ, Trillian remains the real deal--at
least for now. Check back for our full review of the final release of AIM
5.1.<br>

<p>In other web-related news, Microsoft has announced their proposed document format, XDocs. XDocs, according to Microsoft, will make it easier to create richly formatted online forms, and to simplify the collection of form data. Because it uses XML, XDocs form data should integrate with a variety of data repositories with relative ease.

<p>The first reaction from tech pundits was to proclaim that a mortal blow had been struck against Adobe, the PDF file format, and Adobe's Acrobat family of PDF manipulation products.

<p>It's a bit premature to be ringing alarm bells for Adobe, though. XDocs will be a strong challenge to certain facets of Acrobat, but there are significant differences between the two products, and where they are similar, Adobe is in a position to put up a good fight.

<p>XDocs's obvious challenge to Acrobat is in the online forms market. In that narrow field, it's clear why XDocs is perceived as a threat: Forms, by their nature, require a client and a server. Between their virtual lock on the office productivity suite market and the popularity of SQL Server, Exchange, and the rest of the .Net server products, Microsoft can address both sides of the forms equation. If XDocs is deeply integrated into Exchange and other .Net server components, as it most likely will be, Microsoft will have a significant selling point.

<p>While Acrobat Reader may be everywhere, it's safe to say that it probably isn't used as often as Office, and Microsoft could gain an advantage in the forms market simply by producing a well designed, easy-to-use product with a user interface that's familiar and inviting to people who already use the other Office products regularly. Adobe's defense against this has been to make it possible to create PDFs from any application, including Office. How these differences will work out competitively remains to be seen, and depend on how well XDocs is executed, and how well both Adobe and Microsoft educate potential customers.<br>

<p>In light of the technologies described above, there has been an increased demand for networking, especially wireless networking, without a real understanding of the underlying concepts of networks in general.  But a network is something you must have in order to share access to the Internet, check e-mail, easily move music and picture files, or simply share a printer. A local area network (LAN) allows you to do all of these things and more, but the network itself functions in the background and is effectively invisible. Because networks operate silently and out of sight, it's more thrilling to buy and use a new laptop or a powerful desktop system, but without a network and the services it brings, those devices can't do many of the things you want them to do. Nobody wants a network, but most people want what a network can bring with it.

<p>Assisting in the push towards better networks, a start-up company  announced new antenna technology on Monday that it says can expand the limits of a popular wireless Internet format, providing access to hundreds or even thousands of portable computer users at distances of more than 2,000 feet within buildings and about four miles outdoors.

<p>The antenna uses the 802.11 technical standard, also known as Wi-Fi, which is currently limited to providing wireless Internet access to several dozen users within a few hundred feet of the transmitter. Wi-Fi is increasingly common in offices, airports, places like Starbucks shops and even in a growing number of households.

<p>Executives for the start-up company, Vivato, based in San Francisco, said they expected their technology to be especially suited to office buildings because it would enable so many more people to use a single Wi-Fi Internet connection simultaneously.

<p>The company does not plan to formally introduce its product or discuss pricing until the first quarter of next year.<br>
