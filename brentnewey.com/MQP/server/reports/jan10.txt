Went over paper.
	- Anitra edited sections 1-4
	- Brent will redo the 2 site diagrams (section 5-design)
	- Anitra will edit section 5 once Brent is done
	- Mike will edit section 6 (experiment design)

Talked about the code:
	- Brent will attempt to find the problem in fill()
	- Mike & Anitra will get code ready to be tested.

Mike will try to finish the graphs, trying:
	- straight line
	- 2-3 different break points for the 2 line model
