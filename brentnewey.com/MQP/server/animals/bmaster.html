<center><b>Bush Master</b></center>

<br><blockquote>
The bushmaster is one of the largest venomous snakes in the Americas and its bite can be fatal. They are mostly solitary and nocturnal.
There are three subspecies of bushmaster snakes: Lachesis muta muta,Lachesis muta noctivaga, and Lachesis muta rhombeata.
Their young are born from eggs, which is unusual because most vipers bear live young. Adult bushmasters reach a length of about 8 - 12 feet.
They are gray and brown and they blend in perfectly with leaf litter on the rainforest floor.
When threatened they shake their tail like a rattlesnake.
