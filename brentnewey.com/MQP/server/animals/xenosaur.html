<br><blockquote>

Xenosaurs are one of four species of lizards that belong to the Xenosauridae Family. They range in size from 10-15 cm.
They are mainly nocturnal land animals, who will sometimes enter the water. Xenosaurs are found in hollow logs, holes in trees, and very narrow crevices. They don't move around too much and mainly wait for prey to come to them.
They give birth to 4-7 live young at a time, instead of laying eggs.
Xenosaurs can deliver a painful bite, but they are not poisonous.
