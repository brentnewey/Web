<center><b>Darwin's Frog</b></center>

Darwin's frog belongs to the Rhinodermatidae family of frogs.
This frog was discovered and named after Charles Darwin.
They are usually about 2-3 centimeters in length, have a triangular head, and a nose that "sticks out".
Darwin's frog is normally greenish or brownish in color.
They are well known for their strange reproductive habits.
The female lays the eggs and the male guards them for about 2-3 weeks. When he sees movement in the eggs he places (swallows) them in his "vocal sac" and carries them around. The young are able to feed off their own egg yolk. When they are fully developed froglets, the male releases them and they are ready to begin life as a Darwin's frog.
They have a local name of "Cowboy Frog" in their native countries. It might be because their "call" sounds like the whistle that herders use to call their cattle. Darwin's frog is threatened by loss of habitat due to human "expansion" into its territory.
