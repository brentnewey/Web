<center><b>Amazon River Dolphin</b></center>

<blockquote><br>
These dolphins can be pink or gray in color. They are one of only 5 species of freshwater dolphin in the world. They are also the largest of the freshwater dolphins. Their diet consists of 43 species of 19 families of fish; they have developed three stomachs to digest these boney fish, turtles, etc. They have an unfused vertebra in their spine so they can more their heads from side to side. No other aquatic mammal has this unfused vertebra. The Amazon River Dolphin is also known as "boto". They are known in Peru as "Bufeo Colorado" but the correct name is "Bufeo Rosado," meaning pink, not red. They can be up to 9 feet long or more and usually weigh between 190-285 pounds. Their echo-location ability is excellent.
During the rainy season, when the Amazon River floods, they swim amongst the rainforest trees, which are under water.
Unlike most dolphin species, this dolphin does not have a dorsal fin, but instead has a ridge on its back.
The Amazon River Dolphin is born a dark gray, but gets pinker as it gets older. Scientists are not quite sure why.
They often hunt and feed alone, but are sometimes found in groups of 5-8.
