Coopers Hill Cheese Rolling and Wake

The famous "Coopers Hill Cheese Rolling and Wake" is an ancient event which takes 
place annually on the Spring Bank holiday in Gloucestershire (UK).
The rules of the game are simple, you show up, you chase cheese off a cliff, 
you tumble for a couple hundred yards, then you go to either the pub or the local hospital.
Coopers Hill Cheese Rolling and Wake is dangerous and can easily result in serious injury or possibly death. 
This year someone wound up being karted off in an ambulance after almost every run - 
and considering only 15 people participate in each run the odds of being injured are not favourable.

Crane and Tortoise Relays

The Crane and Tortoise Relays are a common part of sports days in Japan.
Teams of four boys carry a cover which looks like a tortoise and run a four-legged race around a track, 
tagging off to a team of girls at the finishline. The team of two girls, wearing crane wings and costumes, 
run a three-legged race around the track, and when they cross the finish line the next team starts off. 
Classes at Yochisha, Japan have 44 students each (32 boys and 12 girls) with three classes (K, E and O) in each grade, 
and all classes from 6 grades compete in this event. The winners are the class who get all their tortoises and 
cranes across the finish line first.

Korfball

Korfball is, to generalise slightly, a bit like netball. Because there's a net. And a ball, incidentally. 
More intriguingly Korfball is, according to the University Korfball club web site, 
"The world's only true mixed team sport in which both men and women compete on equal grounds."
Invented by a Dutch schoolteacher 101 years ago, Korfball was first played in England in South London in 1946. 
There are now clubs all over the country and the university has teams in the Central England Korfball League. 
Teams are made up of 4 men and 4 women, and there are rules that make it equal for men and women 
(You are only allowed someone of your own sex for example).
