<h3>Summary written by Brent</h3>

<h4>Genetic Algorithms</h4>

<p>Chapter 25, being the section of importance in relation to this project, deals with an
overview of what genetic algorithms simulate (that is, the theory of evolution), and includes
the details of mapping traits to chromosomes, survival of the fittest, etc.  It uses examples
to illustrate crossover and mutation, and defines these terms in a didactic manner (it's a
textbook).  It should be noted that while the book contains formulae for determining outcomes
and some pseudocode, little actual implementation is discussed.</p>

<p>This book does a good job of discussing the logistics and concerns of genetic algorithms.
It generally tends to present each section of its discussion in outline format, along with
many examples and figures.  It discusses the reasoning behind each aspect of genetic algorithms
(necessity of crossover and mutation techniques), and the primary methods for testing the fitness
of individuals (Pure fitness vs. Quality Rank).  It also touches on why diversity may be desired
over absolute fitness.</p>
