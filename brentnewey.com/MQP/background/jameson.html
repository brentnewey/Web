<h3>Summary by Brent Newey</h3>

<p>This is a tutorial for "Designing User-Adaptive Systems".  It includes a deal of
preliminary explanation of terms (such as the difference between "adaptibility" and "adaptation").
  It also discusses the benefits and drawbacks of adaptation in a general sense, as well
as general classifications of the types of users likely to use adaptives systems (skill level,
for example).  </p>

<p>The tutorial then breaks down a variety of
existing models for adaptive websites.  The more important examples illustrate the following:
Medical Systems, Product Recommendations (Amazon stuff), News Servers (CNN stuff), Online Help
(Stupid Microsoft Paper Clip), or general navigation and menu support.  It also illustrates
a bunch of other adaptive systems of less relevance to Adaptive Hypermedia.</p>

<p>Each example is broken down, explained, and its Adaptive System diagrammed
(user metrics->computation->user model->computation->adaptation).</p>
