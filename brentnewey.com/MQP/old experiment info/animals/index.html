<p><A HREF="amphibians.html">Amphibians</A> include frogs, toads, and salamanders. They have moist, smooth skin and are cold-blooded. Amphibians start life as aquatic larvae, but undergo metamorphosis to become land-dwelling adults. Frogs and toads lose their tails in this metamorphosis, but salamanders do not.</p>

<p><A HREF="mammals.html">Mammals</A> are warm-blooded and have four limbs. Most give birth to live young, and all feed their young milk. Not all adult mammals have hair, but all mammals have hair at the beginning of their lives. Mammals include whales, dolphins, humans, cats, rodents, dogs, and many other animals. Mammals are also the only animal with a diaphragm, or with three bones in their ears.</p>

<p><A HREF="reptiles.html">Reptiles</A> have dry, scaly skin. This class of animals includes turtles, snakes, lizards, and crocodiles. Like the amphibians, they are cold-blooded. Unlike the amphibians, they either lay terrestrial eggs or give birth to live young. Reptiles vary quite a bit in their other physical characteristics. Snakes do not have legs, and lizards have legs appropriate to their lifestyle - short and powerful for burrowers, or long for fast-moving lizards. All snakes and crocodiles are predators, but some lizards and turtles are herbivorous.</p>
