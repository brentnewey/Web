<center><b>Komodo Dragon</b></center>

<br><blockquote>
The largest of the monitor lizards, the Komodo dragon can grow up to 10 feet long. The males (up to 300 pounds) are bigger than females (up to 200 pounds).  They usually live around 20 years, but can live longer.
They shed and replace their teeth, just like a shark.
They are capable of swimming and are very fast runners, but only for a short distance. If hungry enough they will eat other Komodo dragons.
The Komodo dragon has a very keen sense of smell. They are an endangered species.
