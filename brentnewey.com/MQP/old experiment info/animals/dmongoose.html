<center><b>Dwarf Mongoose</b></center>

<blockquote><br>


These mongooses have four or five toes on each foot and have non-retractable claws. They have 35-40 teeth. They can live up to 10 years of age. Some live longer, some live less. Dwarf Mongooses live in a "pack" and are highly socialized. The average pack size is about 8.
They live in "termite-like" dens, sometimes actually in old abandoned termite mounds. During the mating season the mother has 2-3 litters of 1-6 young. The young are born with fur and are blind.
Dwarf Mongooses have a highly developed inner ear and their hearing and eyesight are excellent. They are diurnal which means most of their activities occur during the daytime.
