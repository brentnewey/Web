    This project is being undertaken as a <a href="http://www.cs.wpi.edu/Programs/mqps/">Major Qualifying Project</a> in the <a href="http://www.cs.wpi.edu">Computer Science Department</a> at WPI.<br><br>
    Duration: A'02 -  D'03

  <h3>Abstract:</h3> This project studied the feasibility of adapting a website using a genetic algorithm, in response to user access patterns.  We created a hierarchical website and allowed a genetic algorithm to modify its structure.  We ran experiments to gather data about how users accessed the site before and after its modification.  We found that user access time generally improved after the site had been modified, and conclude that this is a viable approach for adaptive websites.
